This is the *HyperCollections* project I made myself.


<div><p>Java developers often face the need to store and process data conveniently. The <strong>Java Collections Framework</strong> can help with this issue, because it includes plenty of standard, highly efficient collections that cover most routine problems. Thanks to this framework, developers usually don't need to create new collections from scratch – they only need to apply or slightly extend the existing ones to solve their needs.</p>

<p>However, sometimes developers face less common issues, for which the standard collections aren't enough. In such cases, alternative libraries such as <strong>Google Guava Collections</strong> or <strong>Apache Common Collections</strong> may help. These libraries contain more collections and an abundance of auxiliary algorithms to work with. Another solution is to write your problem-specific collections. This is typically much more complicated and not always the best solution, but it isn't forbidden either.</p>

<p>Besides, there are some design drawbacks inherited in the Java Collections Framework, which can even lead to bugs in your programs. Some approaches used in this library are considered obsolete now and are normally avoided in modern libraries such as <strong>Kotlin Collections</strong>, <strong>Scala Collections,</strong> or even <strong>TypeScript Collections</strong> (yeah, it is far from Java but still a library!).</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/319?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/319</a>
